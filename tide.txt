/* Extra configuration file to manage the tide. Every line on
this file is to be considered a "tide command" for the tide,
where such command can be either "tide flow" (F) or "tide ebb" (E).
The tide process will execute each line command, but only after 
waiting some time (in microseconds) as such line indicates.
The format for each line of the file must be:
<Command letter (F or E)> : <time to wait before executing>
where the spaces and the end of line are compulsory.*/
F : 50000
F : 66000
E : 32000
F : 45666
E : 77777
